# SMTP Forwarder

Listend and forwards SMTP messages to another sever.

It's mainly used as a bridge between old mail clients and mail servers that don't accept old TLS versions anymore (like AWS SES).

The local server listens on `0.0.0.0:8025`.  
Then the mail is forwarded to the server set in the `forward_email` function.
